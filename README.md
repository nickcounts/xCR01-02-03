# ☒CHIP CR01/CR02/CR03

## General Description
The SX1276/77/78/79 transceivers feature the LoRaTM long
range modem that provides ultra-long range spread
spectrum communication and high interference immunity
whilst minimising current consumption.

Using Semtech’s patented LoRaTM modulation technique
SX1276/77/78/79 can achieve a sensitivity of over -148dBm
using a low cost crystal and bill of materials. The high
sensitivity combined with the integrated +20 dBm power
amplifier yields industry leading link budget making it
optimal for any application requiring range or robustness.

LoRaTM provides significant advantages in both blocking
and selectivity over conventional modulation techniques,
solving the traditional design compromise between range,
interference immunity and energy consumption.

These devices also support high performance (G)FSK
modes for systems including WMBus, IEEE802.15.4g. The
SX1276/77/78/79 deliver exceptional phase noise,
selectivity, receiver linearity and IIP3 for significantly lower
current consumption than competing devices.
